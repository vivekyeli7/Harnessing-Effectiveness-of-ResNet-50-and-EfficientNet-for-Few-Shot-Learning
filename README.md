# Harnessing Effectiveness of ResNet-50 and EfficientNet for Few-Shot Learning

## Abstract
Inspired by the concept of human intelligencelearning and expanded upon with several examples – severalstep learning focused on computers that can classify images in
a similar way. This article covers the interesting field of sparse
learning, focusing on comparing its implementation using two
popular deep learning networks: ResNet and EfficientNet. Little
learning has the potential to be effective on tasks where obtaining
large data sets is expensive or impossible; This allows machines to
mimic humans’ ability to learn and expand from small samples,
thus opening up possibilities in the field of various types of
diagnostics, personalized recommendations, systems and robotics.
Our main goal is to measure and compare the accuracy achieved
by these models when learning on limited datasets and to show
that EfficientNet achieves better accuracy when it requires fewer
parameters and computational resources compared to ResNet50. We considered VGG-flowers dataset for comparison. Our
results show that Narrow EfficientNet outperforms ResNet-50 in
terms of overall accuracy (85.20% vs. 84.30%), precision (85.60%
vs. 85.40%), recall (85.30% vs. 84.50%) and F1 acquisition
(85.45% vs. 84.95%). This suggests that EfficientNet’s emphasis
on computational efficiency and parallelism may provide a slight
advantage on limited data.

## Overview

Few-shot learning aims to enable machine learning models to generalize effectively with minimal data, mimicking human-like learning capabilities. This study benchmarks ResNet-50 and EfficientNet in terms of:

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-Score**

### Key Findings

- **EfficientNet** outperformed ResNet-50 across all metrics with slightly better accuracy (85.20% vs. 84.30%) and computational efficiency.
- ResNet-50, while slightly less accurate, remains a strong candidate due to its robustness and scalability.

## Methodology

1. **Dataset:**  
   - **VGG-Flowers Dataset**: Contains 4242 images categorized into five classes: Chamomile, Tulip, Rose, Sunflower, and Dandelion.
   - Features include diverse resolutions and proportions, suitable for real-world classification tasks.

   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

## Performance Comparison

| Model       | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| ResNet-50   | 84.30%   | 85.40%    | 84.50% | 84.95%   |
| EfficientNet| 85.20%   | 85.60%    | 85.30% | 85.45%   |


## Conclusion 
Therefore, both ResNet-50 and EfficientNet are strong candidates for solving many image classification problems. Their
unique architectural features and design make them useful
tools for dealing with annotation events. However, a full
understanding of their advantages and limitations is important
for making informed decisions about their applications in
specific areas.
Our results show that EfficientNet outperforms ResNet-50
in several benchmarks, especially when applied to the VGGFlowers dataset. This finding is consistent with EfficientNet’s
design concept, which emphasizes achieving high performance
standards with limited resources.
EfficientNet’s ability to provide better results on the VGGflowers dataset proves that it can be a good solution for
working with limited data. The integration method used by
EfficientNet provides high performance in low-budget applications by simultaneously adjusting the depth, width and
resolution of the network.
While EfficientNet shows its power in some situations,
it is important to remember: the choice between ResNet50 and EfficientNet depends on the specific requirements of
the project at hand. With its deep and continuous structure,
ResNet-50 can perform well in situations where capture is
important. On the other hand, the effectiveness of EfficientNet
is more evident in fewer areas.
Ultimately choosing the best tool depends on a detailed
understanding of the data, computing resources and performance characteristics. Our study advances this understanding
by demonstrating the effectiveness of EfficientNet in analyzing
multiple vaccines, giving clinicians and researchers a better
understanding of photographic solutions in situations where
information is limited.
